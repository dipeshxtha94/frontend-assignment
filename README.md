To run the react project 'OnlineStore' locally,
           if we go for npm, then we can start the react project with 'npm start' command
           if we go for yarn, then we can start the react project with 'yarn start' command

In this project, i had used following technologies:
 -redux-toolkit (for state management)
 -react-hook-form (for form handling and form validation)
 -tenstack query (to handle data fetching from api endpoint)
 -react-router-dom (for page routing)
 -typescript (to avoid type conflict)
 -tailwindcss (for styling)
